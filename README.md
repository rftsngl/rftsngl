# Hi, I’m Rıfat Sinanoğlu 👋

**I’m studying Software Engineering at Samsun University.**  
Ever since I first discovered technology, I’ve been passionate about software development, exploring new ideas, and especially pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence.

When I code, I focus not just on results, but on understanding the logic behind the process. Facing challenges only motivates me to look from different angles and find lasting solutions.

I enjoy working with modern tools and up-to-date technologies in my projects. For me, games aren’t just a hobby—they’re also a way to get inspired by the systems and algorithms that power them.  
Staying current, learning something new every day, and growing with each project are what drive me.

> _For me, software engineering isn’t just a job; it’s a journey of curiosity and discovery._  
> _I love sharing what I learn, inspiring others, and becoming a little better every day._
