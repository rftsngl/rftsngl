# Hi, I’m Rıfat. 
I’m studying Software Engineering at Samsun University. Ever since I first encountered technology, I’ve been fascinated by software development, experimenting with new ideas, and especially exploring the possibilities of artificial intelligence. When I code, I focus not only on results but also on understanding the logic behind the process. Whenever I face challenges, instead of giving up, I try to look at problems from different perspectives and find lasting solutions.

I enjoy using modern tools and up-to-date technologies in my projects. For me, games aren’t just a hobby; analyzing the systems and algorithms behind them inspires me. Staying up to date with different resources and learning something new every day means a lot to me.

For me, software engineering is more than just a job—it’s a journey of curiosity and discovery. I’m passionate about sharing what I learn, inspiring others, and becoming a little better every day.
